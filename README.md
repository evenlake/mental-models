# mental-models

A mental model is a representation of reality that we keep in our minds. They are not always correct representations of reality.  

Many people are ound the web are trying to define and learn mental models, but often the hardest thing about learning them, is finding them in the first place. When you look for them anywhere, it's basically something like, "you should have a mental model of [insert subject here]." No example of what the model is, no direction of how to acquire one, and very little about how to create your own.  

This project is meant to collect as many mental models as possible, and keep them in a singel repository for reference.  

If you are going to contribute to this repository,each mental model should be its own file. The file should define a single mental model, i.e. Thermodynamics. Explain briefly what it is, list articles or books where one could learn more, an example of why it's important, and an idea of how it can fit into a latticework with other mental models.
